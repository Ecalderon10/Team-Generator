##Description

This application was built to help any employeer document their employees with the proper credintials being entered pertaining to the proper employee.

1. When first approaching this projecct I started off with building out the test for each individual employee

2.Once the tests were complete, I moved on to building out the .Js for each employee

3. When building out the .js for each employee proper functions and questions had to be listed

4. When connecting each .js I extended the emplyee .js to the other files using class/extend

5. After extending each file I made sure that my server.js was properly built out with prompting the employer with this the accuarate questions for each employee

6. Once the questions and tests passed after having the user insert its inputs I continued onto the appending portion

7. When approaching the appending part of the project. I had to make sure that I had empty strings to input the correct information into them that the employeer had provided

8. Once this was down, I created a empty const to input the layout oof each card that was going to be appened to the index.html

9. Finally I wrote out the proper functions to append all the info into the html once the employeer had selected that they wished not to add anymore employees to the team generator
